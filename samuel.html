            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Samuel Hahnemann, born in 1755, was a German physician best known for founding the system of homeopathy. Frustrated with the ineffective and often harmful practices of conventional medicine during his time, Hahnemann developed the principles of homeopathy, which emphasize the body’s ability to heal itself through the use of highly diluted substances.</p>
            <p>Homeopathy has since become a popular alternative medicine, and Hahnemann’s ideas revolutionized the treatment of illnesses in the 19th century.</p>

            <h2>His Contributions to Medicine</h2>
            <p>Hahnemann’s contributions to medicine were groundbreaking. He introduced the concept of "like cures like," which is the basis of homeopathy. This means that a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can be used in diluted form to treat similar symptoms in a sick person.</p>
            <p>He also popularized the use of potentization (dilution) in medicines, where remedies are diluted and succussed (shaken vigorously) to enhance their healing properties. This principle continues to be the foundation of homeopathic treatments today.</p>

            <h2>Legacy and Influence</h2>
            <p>Hahnemann’s work laid the foundation for the development of homeopathy as a distinct medical system. Although it faced criticism from traditional medical professionals, homeopathy gained popularity worldwide and has millions of adherents to this day.</p>
            <p>Hahnemann’s writings and teachings have inspired generations of practitioners who believe in treating patients holistically and with individualized care. His work continues to influence alternative medicine practices across the globe.</p>
